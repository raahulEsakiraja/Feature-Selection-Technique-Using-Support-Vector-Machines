# Feature-Selection-Technique-Using-Support-Vector-Machines

This project investigates feature selection techniques in the context of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to improve model efficiency, reduce overfitting, and enhance interpretability. Feature selection plays a critical role in high-dimensional datasets, where irrelevant or redundant features can degrade the performance of SVM classifiers. By selecting the most informative features, we aim to streamline the learning process while maintaining or even improving classification accuracy.
